<p>Spanning nearly 3.8 million square miles, the United States is the third-largest country in the world by land area.

The nation's founding in 1776 marked a significant turning point in world history, as a group of 13 colonies declared their independence from British rule. This bold declaration set the stage for the American Revolutionary War, which ultimately led to the birth of a new nation. Over the centuries, America has faced and overcome numerous challenges, including a civil war, economic crises, and social upheaval. These experiences have contributed to the nation's robust democratic institutions and its commitment to individual freedoms.</p>
